Scenario:
Implement a class “Transaction” in which daily transactions are recorded in a dynamic array consisting of Product_id and SalesPerson_id providing a constant product price and static revenue variable to record revenue of all instances of transactions for a given day.  Now display daily closing in a given format:

Transaction_01
SalesPerson_id: Asim123
Product_id: Dairy01
Cost=1000rs
Revenue per transaction= 150rs  
Total Revenue of all transactions.

Hint: Static will be use to save total revenue. 

Write a C++ code to create at least 10 objects of transactions from Transaction_01 to Transaction_10.
